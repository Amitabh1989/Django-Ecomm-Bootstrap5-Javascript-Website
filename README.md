Truly, it's a fan moment for me. This combination of Django + Bootstrap + Javascript + SQLite <b>=</b> THIS AWESOME WEBSITE!

Lean all about a fully functional (well, almost, not hosted)...education level project where you get to know how things work in real life. It has been a complete amazing pleasure of mine having coded this for all of you out there.

## Few screen shots from the website is as below.

### Screenshot 1 : Products page + Fully functional Cart + Fully Functional Search

### Screenshot 2 : Checkout Page : Fully functional cart items, total amount, address and Database interaction
